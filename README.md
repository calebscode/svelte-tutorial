# Example "Gaming Guides" Single-Page-App built with SvelteKit
- I am building this to learn SvelteKit as a way to triangulate my knowledge of other frameworks.
- The video series I am following is from Net Ninja on YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OlLxkaeVvw&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9hpM9ARM59Ve3jqcb54dqiP">found here</a>.

# Running the project
1. Clone the repo or download the source from GitHub
2. `cd` into the root directory and run `npm install` to get all dependencies (recent Node version required)
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the app locally. Svelte will find an open port and give you a link in the terminal.
